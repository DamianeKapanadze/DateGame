The game starts on January 1. Each of two players takes turns calling out another date. The new date has to be a later date in the year with either the same month OR the same day (from January 1, a player can call out a later day in January or another month with the day 1 like February 1, March 1, etc.).

The person who calls out December 31 wins the game.
